      What a wonderful smell you've discovered.



### Rooms ###
Curved Path: !!room &id_Curved_Path
  description:
    nouns: /path|rail|curve/
    desc: |
      You shiver as the wind coming up the ravine blows across this gently curved walkway, which runs between the main Observatory and the Annex. It always feels a bit rickety, but you're usually too cold to notice it shaking too much. 


Cave Entrance: !!room

    nouns: /trademark/

Inside the Barrow: !!room
  description: 
    nouns: /barrow|cave|entrance/
    desc: |
      You are incide an ancient barrow hidden deep within a dark forest. The barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. You can see a faint glow at the far end.
      A strangely familiar brass lantern is lying on the ground.
      A sword of Elvish workmanship is on the ground. 
      *Just kidding*. There's no sword.


Under Curved Path: !!room &id_Under_Curved_Path
  description:
    nouns: /snow|path|rail|curve/
    desc: |
      Wind whistles through the trusses of the walkway above, and the snow under your feet cracks a bit under your feet as you walk. You recall that there's an entrance to both the *Observatory* and the *Annex* that you can get to from down here.


Mountains: !!room &id_Mountains
  description: 
    nouns: /hills|snow|mountains/
    desc: |
      You're in the mountains around the Observatory. While playing in the snow is fun, you're getting worried, as conditions can get really awful out here. Dying of exposure is easier than you think.


Dome Roof: !!room &id_Observatory_Roof
  description:
    nouns: /roof|dome|top/
    desc: |
      You're standing on the top of the dome, and the wind is blowing pretty hard. It's slippery, icy, and downright dangerous to be up here like this. One wrong move, and you'll fall into the dome and ruin some expensive apparatus, or you'll fall outwards, and get impaled on something else.


Outside the Observatory: !!room &id_Outside
  description:
    nouns: /path|rail|curve/
    desc: |
      This path runs all the way around the circumference of the building. You recall that they lock all of these doors when nobody is around. You might need to find another way in.


Outside the Annex: !!room &id_Outside_Annex
  description:
    nouns: /annex|outside|building/
    desc: |
      You're just outside the Annex.


Balcony: !!room &id_Observatory_Balcony
  description:
    nouns: /rail|balcony/
    desc: |
      You're standing on a balcony on the outside of an enormous dome. The dome curves up and away, disappearing into the snowy sky.
      
      You see a doorway here, which leads into the *Observatory*.


Stairwell: !!room &id_Observatory_Stairwell
  description:
    nouns: /stair(s|well)/
    desc: | 
      You're at one of the entrances to this large observatory. A perilous set of stairs lead upwards, to the *Control Room*, and a second set lead downwards. 


Rickety Stairs: !!room &id_Observatory_Rickety_Stairs
  description:
    nouns: /stairs|shaky/
    desc: | 
      The stairs themselves seem pretty sturdy to you, but the lack of a handrail is, at best, vexing. Looking over the edge, you can see that you're almost exactly above the secondary, reflecting telescope.


On the Telescope: !!room &id_Observatory_On_Telescope
  description:
    nouns: /telescope|reflection|refraction|lens/
    desc: | 
      You managed to get on top of the telescopes. 
      
      (What are you doing? Get down from there!)


Circular Area: !!room &id_Observatory_Circular
  description:
    nouns: /circular|catwalk/
    desc: | 
      You're standing on a circular platform, at the apex of the observatory's dome. One path leads around behind the upper room, and through a door you can see some steps leading up to the *Main Control Room*.


Canopy: !!room &id_Observatory_Canopy
  description:
    nouns: /outside|canopy|aperature/
    desc: | 
      You're anxious because you're standing on the section of the dome that opens and closes to protect the telescopes from weather. If it opened, you'd fall right into the telescope. You begin to look for an exit.


Main Control Room: !!room &id_Observatory_Control
  description:
    nouns: /main|control|observatory/
    desc: | 
      This is the primary control room, where the scientists probably would have worked. If it were less cold outside, you could easily imagine living and working up here: the view must be astounding on a clear day.


Viewing Platform: !!room &id_Observatory_Viewing_Platform
  description:
    nouns: /lounge|view|platform/
    desc: | 
      There is a hemispherical room at the top of this Observatory. It has a high window, so the stars can be viewed, unobstructed, without fear of falling into the telescopes. Another door leads out to the roof.


Ground Floor: !!room &id_Observatory_1
  description:
    nouns: /floor|ground|base/
    desc: | 
      You're on the ground floor of the Observatory. Two massive telescopes dominate the enclosed area, while trusses and walkways extend upwards. The Observatory is not airtight, so even inside, it's quite cold.


Canyon Path: !!room &id_Canyon_Path
  description:
    nouns: /cliffs|crag|path/
    desc: |
      You are along a sandy path, which weaves its way through cragged rocks. It runs along the inside edge of a canyon, and you can hear water lapping against rocks. It's breezy: while the sun feels warm on your skin, you shiver slightly when a strong gust blows into the canyon.


Quarantine Gate: !!room &id_Quarantine_Gate
  description:
    nouns: /quarantine|gate|stone/
    desc: |
      A brilliant white stone wall bars your passage through this area. This structure looks ancient, but seems to have held up very well over the ages. A tall, walled path runs directly through the middle of the structure. An equally ancient obelisk stands tall at the entrance.
      The obelisk reads:
          ### **D I A Z A R A D** ###


Quarantine Hall: !!room &id_Quarantine_Hall
  description:
    nouns: /quarantine|hall|stone/
    desc: |
      A short corridor leads from the entrance of the Quaranatine to the Abbey, which appears to have filled with sand. A collapsed room and a marketplace can be found to either side, through thick doors.


Quarantine Marketplace: !!room &id_Quarantine_Marketplace
  description:
    nouns: /quarantine|hall|market|stone/
    desc: |
      This used to be a market, where traders would set up shop at granite slabs, and barter for goods coming in and out of the Quarantine. Now it's been cleared out, and only a few clay pots, and the worn counters remain.
      

Quarantine Customs Office: !!room &id_Quarantine_Customs
  description:
    nouns: /quarantine|hall|market|stone/
    desc: |
      This room must once have been the main administrative center for this Quarantine. Rocks have since collapsed into it, and very little else remains.


Quarantine Abbey: !!room &id_Quarantine_Abbey
  description:
    nouns: /quarantine|hall|market|stone/
    desc: |
      This Abbey would have been a rather pleasant place to relax before this area was abandoned. Now the grass has overgrown, and sand has blown into the doorway on the other side, barring all entry into this land.


Quarantine Obelisk: !!room &id_Quarantine_Obelisk
  description:
    nouns: /quarantine|hall|market|stone/
    desc: |
      There is another obelisk here in the sand, mostly obscured.
      Only the top is visible, and it reads:
        ### **D I A Z A R A D** ###
        These lands have been barred indefinitely by the Council.


Upper Pathway: !!room &id_Upper_Pathway
  description:
    nouns: /upper|path|high/
    desc: |
      This path leads up to a rocky outcrop, which provides an astounding view of the landscape, and of the ancient monument. From up here you can almost see into the nearer rooms of the Quarantine Gate.


Lower Pathway: !!room &id_Lower_Pathway
  description:
    nouns: /lower|path|low/
    desc: |
      This path leads from the Quarantine downwards, towards the waterline, and continues through jagged rocks. It looks well worn, as if many have walked this path to get to the Quarantine Gates.


Canyon Arch: !!room &id_Canyon_Arch
  description:
    nouns: /arch|rock|path/
    desc: |
      This rock structure is truly something to behold. It is a single slab of sanstone, spanning quite a distance, stretched between two giant boulders. It might be twice as tall were it not for all this sand.
