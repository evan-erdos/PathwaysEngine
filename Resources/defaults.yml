  Thing: !!thing
    seen: false
    description:
      name: thing
      styles: [ Paragraph ]
      nouns: /thing|object/

      help: |
        You can usually refer to things via common nouns and phrases. However, if too many similar things are nearby, you may need to use exact names. The exact names of nearby objects are listed when your commands are too ambiguous.
        
        Example Commands:
        - <cmd>**look**</cmd>
        - <cmd>**examine thing**</cmd>
        - <cmd>**search object**</cmd>


      desc: |
        This is a completely unremarkable thing. It has no special features or inherent value of its own. 


  Creature: !!creature
    description:
      name: creature
      styles: [ Paragraph, Alert ]
      desc: |

        - <cmd>**speak to him**</cmd>
        - <cmd>**warn her about the rabid ostrich**</cmd>

      desc: |
        This person doesn't seem to have much to say to you. Dressed in nondescript clothing, you suspect that this person does not live a very interesting life. While you *could* make small talk, it would be mostly out of courtesy.

  Room: !!room
    description:
      name: room
      styles: [ Paragraph ]
      nouns: /room|place/

      desc: |
        This is a door. Like other doors, it's pretty likely that this one opens and closes. Additionally, just like other doors, it certainly could be locked.

  Book: !!book
    cost: 10
    mass: 1
    passage : |
      This is one of the most boring pieces of literature you have ever come across. It is so dry that you cannot bear to look at the pages for another moment before putting it down. You ignore it, and go about your travels with a fresh taste of disgust for people who wear suits.

    description:
      name: book
      styles: [ Paragraph ]
      nouns: /book|paper|page|reading|writing/

      help: |
        If you have the proper key, it will automatically be used to unlock any door you approach.

      desc: |
        This is a pretty bland key, and you're not sure where you found it. It could unlock almost anything, and probably doesn't unlock anything nearby.

        You can pull levers via clicking and dragging

      desc: |
