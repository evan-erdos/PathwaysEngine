unusual note: !!book
  passage: |
    The note is very short, and very unusual. It reads:

    > wagner plays,
    > hitler waves,
    > storm clouds gather in nuremberg
    
    You have a hard time determining what this means.

      This little letter is quite strange, it's just three lines.


note for George: !!book
  passage: |
    The note is ripped along the bottom, but you can make out the rest. 
    It reads:

    >George,
    > When you leave tonight, remember to leave 4 & 5 as such (unreadable) off (unreadable)

    desc: |
      This old note seems to have gotten wet, and has some mud on it.


note for Aldous: !!book
  passage: |
    The letter reads:

    >Aldous,
    >An urgent matter has come up, and I fear I will be away for quite some time. I have chosen you to manage my work in the interim.

    > The circuits on 2 & (you guess, 5) have been misbehaving, so I've rewired the main fuse box to automatically shut off if they're activated, to prevent any damage to the other systems.

    > Remember to only pull the final power switch AFTER you've turned off all the power. You didn't last time.

    > Regards,
    >    Trevelyan

    desc: |
      This is the Annex to the main Observatory.


Observatory Door: !!door
  lock message: |
    It's a bit rusty, but it's unlocked.

  description:
    nouns: /door|portal/
    desc: |
      This door looks pretty rough: its strong, wrought-iron construction is withering in the elements, and you can see rust beginning to form in the corners.

  locked: true
  lock message: |
    The handle for this door is missing, you can't open it.

  description:
    nouns: /door|portal/

lever: !!lever

    nouns: /lever|crank/
    help: |  
      (either click on the lever to pull it, or type **pull lever**.)

    desc: |
      This is a rather unremarkable lever. It might cause something interesting to happen if you were to pull it.


Metal Pathway: !!thing
  description:
    nouns: /path(way)?|floor|metal/
    desc: |
      This is a rather unsteady metal pathway which bridges the gap between the Observatory and the Annex.


Obelisk: !!thing
  description:
    nouns: /obelisk|rock|pillar|sign/
    desc: |
      This pillar was cut from solid granite, and has a small inscription across its base.


Desk: !!thing
  description: 
    nouns: /desk|table|surface|wood/
    desc: |
      It's a hardwood desk, and from the looks of it, it's very old. It's ornate, but also very strange, as it has clawed feet and inlays which don't seem to be made from any wood you've ever seen.


Stack of Papers: !!thing
  description:
    nouns: /paper(s)?|stack/
    desc: |
      It's a stack of blank papers, which appear to have gotten slightly wet somehow.


Strange Note Half: !!book
  passage: |
    It reads:
      >Dearest Anton,
    
      >I pen these lines to you betwixt hastily packing my trunk and holding a feverish vigil over my bedroom window, as I am certainly being followed.
      
      >I have no other recourse than to write you, and it pains me so. Were my circumstances any less dire I would find another way. I implore you, Anton, to find it in your heart to forgive me, if only for a day. I know all too well the hurt I've caused you, and by writing to you, I may be endangering your life in turn, which pains me even more deeply than you know.
      
      >That day at the Digsite, just before we packed up the tools, I found... an artefact. I hesitate to divulge any...
      
    The message seems quite dire. Unfortunately, you have no idea who Anton is, nor do you have any idea where he might be. 

  description:
    nouns: /note|half|top|letter|paper|message|scrap/
    help: |
      (type **read note half** to read the note.)

    desc: |
      This note is slightly damp, and pretty crumpled. It's ripped along the bottom edge, which suggests that there's liable to be another section of this note somewhere.


Strange Note: !!book
  passage: |
    Though it's torn across the top, the rest is still legible. It reads:
      >...anything further: if this letter were to fall into the wrong hands... I fear the worst. 
      
      >I sent a package to help you find me and the artefact, but I had to be cryptic. I must be certain that you are the only one who can find the artefact. Some of the clues are rather personal. I truly hate to bring such ugly memories to the fore, but these are dangerous times.
      
      >I know neither how dangerous the artefact itself is, nor what lengths the men who chased me might go to, I simply know that you always came through for me, and if you were to do so just one last time, I would be forever in your debt.
      
      >Forever yours,
      >    Adaline
    
    This seems like it's extremely far-fetched, but then again, you woke up in a strangers house this morning, so, really anything is possible.

      (type **read note** to read the note.)

    desc: |
