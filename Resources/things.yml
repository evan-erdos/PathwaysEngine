desk: !!thing
  description: 
    nouns: /desk|table|surface|wood/
    desc: |
      It's a hardwood desk, and from the looks of it, it's very old. It's ornate, but also very strange, as it has clawed feet and inlays which don't seem to be made from any wood you've ever seen.

    nouns: /paper(s)?|stack/
    desc: |
      It's a stack of blank papers, which appear to have gotten slightly wet somehow.


strange note half: !!book
  passage: |
    It reads:
      >Dearest Anton,
    
      >I pen these lines to you betwixt hastily packing my trunk and holding a feverish vigil over my bedroom window, as I am certainly being followed.
      
      >I have no other recourse than to write you, and it pains me so. Were my circumstances any less dire I would find another way. I implore you, Anton, to find it in your heart to forgive me, if only for a day. I know all too well the hurt I've caused you, and by writing to you, I may be endangering your life in turn, which pains me even more deeply than you know.
      
      >That day at the Digsite, just before we packed up the tools, I found... an artefact. I hesitate to divulge any...

    desc: |
      This note is slightly damp, and pretty crumpled. It's ripped along the bottom edge, which suggests that there's liable to be another section of this note somewhere.


strange note: !!book
  passage: |
    It's torn across the top, but the rest is still legible. It reads:
      
      >...anything further: if this letter were to fall into the wrong hands... I fear the worst. 
      
      >I sent a package to help you find me and the artefact, but I had to be cryptic. I must be certain that you are the only one who can find the artefact. Some of the clues are rather personal. I truly hate to bring such ugly memories to the fore, but these are dangerous times.
      
      >I know neither how dangerous the artefact itself is, nor what lengths the men who chased me might go to, I simply know that you always came through for me, and if you were to do so just one last time, I would be forever in your debt.
      
      >Forever yours,
      >    Adaline
