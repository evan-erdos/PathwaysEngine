The `PathwaysEngine` is the culmination of my efforts to create a game engine. It has aspects of [FPS][]s, [RPG][]s, and, perhaps uniquely, [Text Adventures][]. Movement and Cameras are controlled by the typical "WASD" & Mouse, but more advanced input is achieved through a text-based command line. The source is written in [C#][], and targets [Unity][], a common game development engine. An [overview][] of the namespaces, and some other important information can be found in the [wiki][].
